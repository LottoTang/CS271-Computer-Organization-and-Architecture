# CS271 Computer Organization and Architecture

There are 6 simple MASM projects to get a handon experience in MASM assembly language.

Project1: Elementary Arithmetic (calculating the sums and difference for 3 numbers)

Project2: Handon experience in MASM Debugger

Project3: Integer Accumulatr (ask for values, validates, finds max & min, and total sum)

Project4: Prime Numbers (using procedure in MASM, display the prime numbers within the user's input value)

Project5: Generating, Sorting and Counting Random Integers (generate array with random numbers, sort the array using sorting algorithm, count the elements)

Project6: Designing low-level I/O procedures (using procedures and macros; not using Irvine32 WriteDec, WriteInt, ReadDec, ReadInt; do sum and average calculation)
